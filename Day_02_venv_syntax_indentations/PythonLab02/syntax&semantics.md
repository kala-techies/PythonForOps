# Python Comments and Syntax Guide

## Single-Line Comments
Use the hash symbol (`#`) to create single-line comments. Any text following the `#` will not be executed when you run the program.

```python
# This is a single-line comment
```

## Multi-Line Comments
Multi-line comments can be created using triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`). Text enclosed within these quotes will be treated as a comment.

```python
'''
This is a multi-line comment.
You can use it to explain complex logic or provide detailed information.
'''
```

**Note**: Multi-line comments may not work as expected in Jupyter notebooks. Instead, consider using `#` for each line.

## Definition of Syntax and Semantics

- **Syntax**: Refers to the set of rules that define the structure of valid statements in a programming language. In simpler terms, syntax is about the correct arrangement of words and symbols in code.

- **Semantics**: Refers to the meaning or interpretation of the symbols, characters, and commands in a language. It describes what the code is supposed to do when executed.

## Basic Syntax Rules in Python

- Python is **case-sensitive**. For example:
  
```python
name = "DevOps"
Name = "MachineLearning"
```

When printing the above variables, you will get two different values:

```python
print(name)  # Outputs: DevOps
print(Name)  # Outputs: MachineLearning
```

## Indentation
Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. It is crucial to maintain consistent spacing (commonly 4 spaces or a tab) for code blocks. Unlike other languages that use braces (`{}`), Python relies on indentation to determine code structure.

```python
if condition:
    # This block is indented
    print("This is part of the block.")
```

## Line Continuation
To continue a statement on the next line, use a backslash (`\`). This helps keep your code readable and organized.

```python
long_variable_name = "This is a very long string that needs to be split " \
                     "across multiple lines."
```

## Multiple Statements on a Single Line
You can place multiple statements on a single line by separating them with semicolons (`;`).

```python
a = 10; b = 5; c = a - b
```

## Understanding Semantics in Python

- **Variable Assignment**: Python is intelligent enough to infer the data type of a variable at the time of assignment.

```python
x = 10       # x is inferred as an integer
name = "DevOps"  # name is inferred as a string
```

This guide provides a foundational understanding of comments, syntax, and semantics in Python. Ensure to follow these guidelines to write clean and effective Python code!
