# Day_01: Project Prerequisites and IDE Setup

In this section, weâ€™ll cover the initial setup required to work efficiently on this project, focusing on choosing the right Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Selecting an IDE that fits your workflow is essential to make coding easier and more productive.

Below is a list of recommended IDEs, each with unique features tailored to different coding preferences and needs. Choose the one that best aligns with your comfort and project requirements. 

> **Note**: My personal recommendation is **Visual Studio Code**, but feel free to explore each option and decide what works best for you.
