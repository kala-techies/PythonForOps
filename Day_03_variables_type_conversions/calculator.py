# Simple Calculator Program

# Prompt the user to enter the first number and convert it to a float
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Prompt the user to enter the second number and convert it to a float
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Perform basic arithmetic operations
sum = num1 + num2              # Addition
difference = num1 - num2       # Subtraction
product = num1 * num2          # Multiplication
quotient = num1 / num2         # Division

# Display the results of the calculations
print("Sum:", sum)
print("Difference:", difference)
print("Product:", product)
print("Quotient:", quotient)
